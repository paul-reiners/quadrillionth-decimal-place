{"name":"quadrillionth-decimal-place","tagline":"Implementation of a Method of Bailey, Borwein, and Plouffe ","body":"<h1>quadrillionth-decimal-place</h1>\r\nAn implementation in C of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) formula that allows you to compute an arbitrary hexadecimal digit of pi without computing any of the preceding digits.\r\n\r\nThis is a project for HarvardX CS50x.\r\n\r\n<h2>Overview</h2>\r\n\r\nThis project is an implementation in C of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) formula. The BBP formula allows \r\nyou to compute efficiently an arbitrary digit of irrational constants that can be expressed in a particular \r\nform. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe_formula for more information.) In particular,\r\nthis program allows you to compute arbitrary hexadecimal digits of pi and arbitrary binary digits of \r\nlog(2). It is accurate out to the 100 millionth hex digit of pi. It can compute the millionth digit in \r\nabout 10 seconds, the 10 millionth digit in about 2 minutes and the 100 millionth digit in about \r\n20 minutes (the BBP algorithm is linear in d where d is the digit place). I used the GNU MP Bignum \r\nLibrary to achieve this level of precision.\r\n\r\n<h2>Features</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Contains an implementation of the general BBP formula.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Compute arbitrary hexadecimal digits of &pi; out to the 100 millionth digit.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Compute arbitrary binary digits of log(2).\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>References</h2>\r\nI was inspired to do this project by reading the short story \"The Center of the Universe\"\r\nin the book \r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reality-Conditions-Short-Mathematical-Fiction/dp/0883855526\">\r\n<i>Reality Conditions</i></a> by Alex Kasman.  Before that, I first learned about \r\nthe BBP formula in the \"What is the Quadrillionth Decimal Place of &pi;?\" chapter\r\nof \r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Crucible-Introduction-Experimental-Mathematics/dp/1568813430\">\r\n<i>The Computer as Crucible</i></a> by Jonathan Borwein and Keith Devlin.  (That (obviously) \r\nis\r\nalso where I stole the title of my project from.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\r\n\r\nThe links below are relative to the installation directory.
