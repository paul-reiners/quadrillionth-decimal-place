        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>
            This project is a C implementation of the algorithm given in 
            <a href="http://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/digits.pdf">
            "On the Rapid Computation of Various Polylogarithmic Constants"</a> 
            by <a href="http://www.davidhbailey.com/">David Bailey</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~pborwein/">Peter Borwein</a>, and 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Plouffe">Simon Pflouffe</a>.
            You might want to print out a copy of this paper to have next to you when reading the rest
            of this document as I will refer to the equations in it.
            The algorithm is commonly known as the <i>Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) formula</i>.
       </p>
       <p>
            The BBP formula allows you to calculate arbitrary digits (expressed in
            a base <i>b</i>) of mathematical constants
             that can be expressed in a particular form:
            <dl>
            <dd>
                <img class="tex" alt="\alpha = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\left[ \frac{1}{b^k} \frac{p(k)}{q(k)} \right]" 
                     src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/5/c/75c6b64a7bfaed0d79f6c3f43aa84a64.png" />
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>where α is the constant, <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are polynomials in integer 
            coefficients, and 
            <i>b</i> ≥ 2 is an integer 
            numerical base.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't want to go into too much detail on the BBP formula,
            but it suffices to say that  <i>&pi;</i>
            and <i>log(2)</i> can be expressed as formulas of this type.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amazing thing about the BBP formula is that it lets you compute an arbitrary digit
            (in base <i>b</i> notation)
            of such constants <i>without computing any of the preceding digits</i>.
            Thus, for example, you can compute the millionth hexadecimal digit 
            of pi without computing any of the preceding digits.  (Note that we compute  
            <i>hexadecimal</i> digits because <i>b</i> in the BBP formula for <i>&pi;</i> is 16.)
        </p>
        <h1>Source code</h1>
        <p>
            I decided to write this project in C because I wanted it to be <i>fast</i>.
            In fact, I needed the code to be fast, since, by its very nature, the algorithm is 
            computation-intensive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project contains the following source files:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                project.c: Contains <i>main()</i> method for interaction with the user.  Lets the user 
                           calculate specified digits of &pi; and <i>log(2)</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                bbp.c: Computes the generic BBP formula.
            </li>
            <li>
                pi.c and log2.c: Implementations of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) formula for &pi; in
                hexadecimal and <i>log(2)</i> in binary.  
            </li>
            <li>
                aux.c: Contains auxiliary routines that are not specific to the
                       Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The files are listed from the top down.  Each file may depend on files listed below, but not
            on any files listed above it.
        <p>
        <p>
            Particular formulas in the BBP paper are implemented by particular methods in my code:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Equation (1.2) is implemented by the function <i>pi_hex</i> in pi.c.
            </li>
            <li>
                Equation (3.4) is implemented by the function <i>compute_bbp</i> in bbp.c.
            </li>
            <li>
                The unnumbered equation for <i>log(2)</i> on page 8 is implemented by the 
                function <i>log_2_binary</i> in log2.c.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Design decisions</h1>
            <p>
                My main design wish in this project was to create a program that would compile and
                run on the CS50 Appliance as is.  That is, I did not want the user to have to 
                install any libraries or do any other extra configuration on the CS50 Appliance in order 
                to compile and run the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I was not able to achieve this.  Part of the algorithm requires implementing
                modular exponentiation in an efficient and precise manner.  The size of the exponents
                can be 1,000,000 or more.  This is implemented in the <i>modular_pow</i> method in aux.c.  
                As you can see, I ended up using the GNU GMP method <i>mpz_powm</i>.  I spent two or three
                (or four) days
                trying to write my own modular exponentiation routine without resorting to using
                a library, but could not get the required precision (<i>absolute</i> precision
                is actually the required precision).
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't feel too bad about this, though.  As it says in the 
                <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation#C">"Modular exponentiation"</a>
                article on <i>Rosetta Code</i>, 
                "Given numbers are too big for even 64 bit integers, so might as well take the lazy 
                route and use GMP".
            </p>
            <p>
                Another rather obvious design decision was to use as much precision as possible.
                Never use an int where I could use an unsigned long long or a double where I could use an
                unsigned long double. 
            </p>
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>
            I wrote many, many test cases for this project.  They are in the test.c file in the test 
            folder.
            (This test code is not particularly well-documented or commented, but I'm not too worried 
            about that.)
            The paper 
            <a href="http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/bbp-alg.pdf">
            "The BBP Algorithm for Pi"</a> by David H. Bailey gives the values
            of many hexadecimal digits of &pi;.  I was able to use those values 
            in my tests to verify the correctness
            of my code.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            I was inspired to do this project by reading the short story "The Center of the Universe"
            in the book 
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reality-Conditions-Short-Mathematical-Fiction/dp/0883855526">
            <i>Reality Conditions</i></a> by Alex Kasman.  Before that, I first learned about 
            the BBP formula in the "What is the Quadrillionth Decimal Place of &pi;?" chapter
            of 
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Crucible-Introduction-Experimental-Mathematics/dp/1568813430">
            <i>The Computer as Crucible</i></a> by Jonathan Borwein and Keith Devlin.  (That (obviously) 
            is
            also where I stole the title of my project from.)
        <p>
        <p>
            Note that this is not the first implementation of the BBP formula (BBP implemented it 
            themselves).
            I suspect it has been implemented in C many times (or, at least, a few times).  However I 
            haven't 
            checked and I did not look at any other implementations.  My implementation was done simply 
            to educate 
            myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I did learn a lot in doing this project.  First, I got a lot more experience in C.
            Second, I learned about an interesting mathematical concept, the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula.
            Third, I learned some interesting tips and tricks for implementing
            high-precision mathematical algorithms.
